# Telling Git about your SSH key
#You can use an existing SSH key to sign commits and tags, or generate a new one specifically for signing. For more information, see "Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent."
#Note: SSH signature verification is available in Git 2.34 or later. To update your version of Git, see the Git website.
#Open Git Bash.
#Configure Git to use SSH to sign commits and tags:
  #git config --global gpg.format ssh
#To set your SSH signing key in Git, paste the text below, substituting /PATH/TO/.SSH/KEY.PUB with the path to the public key you'd like to use.

#git config --global user.signingkey /PATH/TO/.SSH/KEY.PUB
